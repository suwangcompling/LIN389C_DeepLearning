# DeepLearning Code

Implementation of various types of neural nets for the course, from scratch and using Keras(super high-level)/Tensorflow(more knobs to turn) libraries

* DL01a_FNN_basics: Feedforward Neural Nets (FNN) basic form (from scratch + Tensorflow).
* DL01b_FNN_extensions: FNN with extensions (regularization, weight initialization, early stopping, learning rate decay, more activation types).
* DL02_CNN: Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN) with Tensorflow (basic + tuning options).
* DL03a_RNN: Recurrent Neural Nets (RNN) with Keras (basic + bi-lstm + tuning options).
* DL03b_RNN: RNN with Tensorflow (bi-lstm).
* DL04_RBM_Autoencoder: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and Autoencoder with Tensorflow.
